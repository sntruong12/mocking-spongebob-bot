This is a Twitter bot that is will monitor another Twitter user. In event of that user tweeting, the bot will translate the tweet into the mocking SpongeBob meme form.

Example:
@twitterUser1 tweets: "sigh what is the meaning of life?"

The bot will then tweet out: "SiGh wHaT Is tHe mEaNiNg oF LiFe?"
Along with the iconic mocking SpongeBob image attached to the tweet.

One of the first obstacles that I faced was how to trigger specific code blocks after another block of code runs first. I used the built in promise API and was able to convert the tweet data that I got when initially checking the account for tweets.
