This is a Twitter bot that will monitor target user. The bot will grab the latest tweet from the target user and will translate the tweet into the mocking SpongeBob meme form.

See this link to learn more about the Mocking SpongeBob meme.

Example of functionality
@targetUser tweets:
sigh what is the meaning of life?

The bot will then tweet out:
targetUser: sigh what is the meaning of life?
me: SiGh wHaT Is tHe mEaNiNg oF LiFe?

*The image of mocking spongebob will be attached to the tweet.

One of the first obstacles that I faced was how to trigger specific code blocks after another block of code runs first. I used promises to structure the asychronous functions and was able to convert the tweet text to the form of what the bot will tweet along with the attached image.

Another issue that I ran into was how to prevent the bot from tweeting the same tweet over and over again.
